  "description": "Developing a multi-stage AI pipeline for a global research knowledge hub. Implemented synthetic data generation and dummy report creation using the OpenAI API, along with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with memory. Currently working toward fine-tuning LLMs on actual research papers and designing multi-agent monitoring with guardrails.",
